    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Web developer, product design and visual design enthusiast, and live-long learner; from Guatemala, born in '95.</p>
    <p>My friends call me Dani (so you too can if you want)</p>
    <h3>I like crafting stuff.</h3>
    <p>I mostly code, but the idea (itself) of creating something is what appeals to me.</p>
    <p>Like, when you have a problem to solve with a clear objective, some set of rules, and a good understanding of what you can do; then, what you got is basically a game.</p>
    <p>There’ll be a process of exploration, gathering information, finding challenges, building up skills and knowledge, design a plan and try, try, try.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and when you try again you learn.</p>
    <p >When you get the gist of the process and start enjoying the steps, it becomes something you want to do everytime.</p>
    <h3>Piece of mind</h3>
    <p>I like to see myself as a dreamer, some romantic idealist who sees towards a world tomorrow that’s far better than today.</p>
    <p>The world might be a real mess right now, though it has been for quite a while (since day 1) and it most surely will be one tomorrow.</p>
    <p>But if everyone strive to get better, even a little every day, and does tomorrow better than today; it might come the day when there’s no mess outside.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, I came up with this ideal:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <mark>Live learning and ajoying, design to improve, change things, make today better than yesterday and share your love.</mark>
    </blockquote>
