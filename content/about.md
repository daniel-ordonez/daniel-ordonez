## About me

Web developer, product design and visual design enthusiast, and live-long learner; from Guatemala, born in '95.

My friends call me Dani (so you too can if you want)

### I like crafting stuff.

I mostly code, but the idea (itself) of creating something is what appeals to me.

Like, when you have a problem to solve with a clear objective, some set of rules, and a good understanding of what you can do; then, what you got is basically a game.  

There'll be a process of exploration, gathering information, finding challenges, building up skills and knowledge, design a plan and try, try, try.

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, you grow and try again.

When you get the gist of the process and start enjoying the steps, it becomes something you want to do everytime.
  

### Piece of mind

I like to see myself as a dreamer, some romantic idealist who sees towards a world tomorrow that's far better than today.

The world might be a real mess right now, though it has been for quite a while (since day 1) and it most surely will be one tomorrow.
  
But if everyone strive to get better, even a little every day, and does tomorrow better than today; it might come the day when there's no mess outside.
  
With that in mind, I came up with this ideal:

> Live learning and ajoying, design to improve, change things, make today better than yesterday and share your love.
