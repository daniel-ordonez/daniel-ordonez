> Philosophy is topic I like but never actually dive-into that much; so, there are many philosophy-related terms that are still new to me.

This time I want to write about **Solipsism**.

I can't tell the first time I encounter this term but it sure caught my attention.

## Solipsism

From the Latin _solus_, meaning **alone**, and _ipse_, meaning **self**.

First thing I like to do after finding a new word is to write-it down and look-it up starting by its **etymology**, because the root of a word can give you a hint of the idea behind the meaning of a word.

So, there's me (self) and no one else (alone).

Solipsism says,

> All that's sure to exist is only what's inside the mind â€”my mind, because I'm the selfâ€” and everything outside it is unsure.

What I experience as reality is because of my mind, that's how I know it exists.

How could I tell if other people exist outside of my mind if?

If I'm the only one I can be sure exists, I'm the only one, I'm the center of everything, I'm alone; everything else must be a product of my mind...
