Philosophy is something I like but never actually dive-into too much, so many terms are new to me; this time I want to write about Solipsism.

I can't tell the first time I encounter this term but it sure caught my attention.

First thing I like to do after finding a new word is to write-it down and look-it up starting by its etymology, because the root of a word can give you a gist of the idea meaning behind the word.

## Solipsism

From the Latin solus, meaning "alone", and ipse, meaning "self".

So, there's me (self) and no one else (alone).

Solipsism says that all that exists is in the mind —my mind, because I'm the self— and everything outside it is unsure.

What I experience as reality is because of my mind, that's how I know it exists. But, how can I tell if other people exist outside of my mind if I cant look inside theirs?

If I'm the only one I can be sure exists, I'm the only one, I'm the center of everything, I'm alone.
