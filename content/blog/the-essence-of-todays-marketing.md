The concept of marketing is quite broad.

Although some people maintain the impression that it only covers advertising and sales, in reality, marketing is more like an umbrella covering a variety of practices, tools, and theories.

> It seems that marketing has been with us since the beginning of commerce thousands of years ago, and its evolution has followed great changes in culture and technology.

The truth is that marketing is always changing, and over time many ways of looking at it have emerged, both for its study and practice.

To better understand how marketing changes, we can compare it to language.

Over time, new words and styles of speaking are added into our vocabulary while others are no longer used, some words become inappropriate, and sometimes we borrow, mix and match words from other places.

In the end, it's a social activity in which we want to convey an idea to achieve something..

Marketing is something that happens between people and it often involves an exchange dynamic (you promise something to the consumer, and receive something in return).

When the way we communicate changes, be it to some cultural or technology change (for example, we went from using phones attached to the wall to having video calls over the Internet), the interaction has to adjust for these changes.

> The ways we interact adjust to changes in culture and new technologies

I hope that with that analogy we are clear on that _marketing is something that changes and adjusts to the current times_.

## Yes, marketing is necessary. But why?


It is important to consider the root cause of why we do something and always keep in mind the goal we seek to achieve.

Many people think that marketing is just advertising,

> If I tell everyone that I sell X and that they want it, they're gonna buy it for sure.

This (wrong) perception is too superficial and doesn't consider other important factors, such as the complexity of the human mind when making decisions, and the role of interactions in the whole process.

This type of fixed mindset is what keeps many businesses repeating the same practices from when they first started 30, 40, or 60 years ago.

If we understand the real reason why it was done in a certain way, and why it worked (or not), we can adapt our marketing strategy to the current (or future) context to ensure that it continues to work.

So why do we do marketing?

From the moment that consumers had an alternative to our product, there's a need to prove our offer is worth more so they chose us.

Therefore, we could say that marketing is _something that has been done for the sake of differentiation_ since the beginning of competition in commerce.

And the reason for wanting to differentiate ourselves is _so the consumer can notice us and choose us over their alternatives_.

This definition may still come a bit short, but at least it focuses on what's important, not on a sale or a product, but **a person who has to make a decision**.


## A brief history of marketing

It is important to distinguish that the current idea of a brand (or branding) is understood as an abstract concept and not as the (literal) brand or physical signage of a product through stamps or impressions.

The latter practice is one of the oldest in marketing, evidenced by labels and packaging dating as far back as 35 CE.

Early marketing efforts already included differentiation techniques with claims of quality, catchy phrases, and logos.

The need to differentiate and attract consumers is not new by any means, but the way to do it has changed and evolved.

In the Middle Ages, there was a great distinction between the rich and the poor, as a result, merchants created special spaces in their stores reserved to serve the rich and noble while serving the rest from a window to the street.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, large towns and cities were established, as a result, strategies were developed to sell to the masses, such as sending catalogs by mail, or giving products to celebrities to attract consumers.

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the middle class and mass production appeared, competition between companies grew and the need for new strategies to ensure a competitive advantage grew.

Around this time, the idea of ​​using demographics to segment consumers based on certain aspects of the population, such as their occupation, social status, education, and language, was popularized.

As a result of the demand for people with specialized knowledge, the first marketing courses were created in universities, and from its study, new ways to look at and practicing it were established (marketing orientations).

### Some popular marketing orientations:

**Production-oriented marketing**: the company focuses on producing more to reduce unit cost; to attract consumers who prefer a more affordable product.

**Sales-oriented marketing**: the company focuses on sales techniques and the customer-seller relationship to attract the consumers looking for a "better deal."

**Product-oriented marketing**: the company seeks to have a unique product differentiated by aspects of quality, such as design, performance, or the technology involved; to attract the consumers seeking a certain status or quality standard.

**Market-oriented marketing**: in a competitive market, the company seeks to better understand the needs of consumers and generate products that meet specific needs or desires, resulting in a greater diversity of products in the market.

And so, little by little a more general definition of marketing was developed, which can be summarized as

Explore, create, and deliver value to profitably meet the needs of a target market.*

This modern definition of marketing is very good to summarize _the marketing process_, where a company explores the needs it can satisfy and offers a value proposition, i.e. a product or service, in exchange for profits.

### The Marketing Process

The goal is to be the consumer's choice over other alternatives, this means that our value proposition must be more attractive, and not only the first time, but it must remain in the customer's mind as the best option always.

To achieve this, our value proposition must deliver value. Not only that, it must be "superior" to the competition's (at least in the eyes of the consumer). This is called **delighting** the consumer.

The first steps of the marketing process focus on getting a proposal that can provide this superior value, and start by choosing a market segment, since the more specific it is, the easier it will be to identify its needs.

The more specific your target market is, the easier it will be to identify its needs.

With a good understanding of the needs and wants of the market, you can design a value proposition (product or service) that alleviates this need or satisfies that desire.

The last part of the process involves profitability; to generate a steady stream of income that allows companies to make a profit from the business.

With the idea of _marketing management_, which involves the measurement of indicators and results; they soon realized that acquiring a new customer can be very expensive; Therefore, it is important to retain customers, and achieve loyalty by creating a close relationship with them.

In the long term, close relationships with customers generate a higher return for multiple reasons: customers tend to buy in greater quantity and frequency, and are more likely to refer others, helping to expand the customer base.

At this point, we already have a good idea of ​​what we mean by marketing.

Create strategies to provide superior value and achieve a close relationship with the consumer.

## Marketing to people, not populations

It only remains to define one more concept, which will help us understand why branding is more important now than ever, and that concept is **psychography**.

The study of human behavior according to their attitudes, aspirations, and other psychological criteria.

Looking back at everything we've seen so far, we know that marketing in practice requires interaction with consumers, but until a few years ago, that interaction was quite one-sided.

And is that you cannot respond to the screen when you see an ad on TV or in the cinema.

Campaigns (marketing) had to be done based on population (demographics) hoping to reach the largest possible audience that shares the same interests.

Entering the era of the internet and global connection, physical limits are no longer a real barrier to communication.

Now a piece of content can be shared and consumed anywhere in the world.

Thanks to advertising giants such as Google, and later Facebook, it became possible (with ease) to measure people's interactions with the content of a campaign in different formats; through clicks, reactions, watch time, shares, and endless other metrics.

All this data and the models that have been generated from it, have allowed us to better understand people's behavior and tastes; and it has led to the trend of generating personalized content, not based on populations that share a physical space, but individuals who share similar likes and ideas.

So now we can generate content for a very specific audience (niche) and still be found and consumed by people on the internet.

## Brand

It is a feeling (a gut feeling) that is generated in consumers towards a piece of content (logo, product, service, name, melody, color, etc.) related to an individual or organization.

In other words, it is **a RESULT**.

The impression that remains on the consumer's mind after some experience with the product, service, or company.

It is something that is created in the consumer; therefore, its interpretation depends on the consumer and is not a single one (each person creates a different image).

Branding is in everything, from the people to the product experience, the packaging, the message, the website, and the graphics, even the physical stores.

It is like a reputation, and as such, we cannot control it in its entirety, but we can influence it to keep it close to the desired point.

> You cannot control the process, but you can influence it. - Marty Neumeier. The Brand Gap.

## Why is branding so important

We now know that people consume based on their beliefs and desires; In addition to how easy it has become to create, share and consume content online, we find ourselves in a scenario flooded with offers and in constant change:

-   People have too many options and too little time
-   Many offers are similar in quality and features
-   We tend to base purchasing decisions on trust

The key here is trust in the brand, and how do we develop it?

In his book Then Brand Gap, Marty Neumeier introduces us to trust as:

> Trust = Reliability + Delight

We already cover the **delight** part in the marketing process, it is about meeting consumer expectations on our value proposition, and going further.

Reliability is a bit more complicated because it is something that must be cultivated in people and can be different for each person.

Companies are constantly making promises to their audience, and not just with their product or service's value proposition, but also with what they say, with their values and their mission statement, and with every social media post.

When one of these promises captures a person's attention, and they deliver, trust can begin to develop; on the other hand, when companies (or people) don't, they not only miss out on this opportunity to connect with their audience but may even kill the relationship completely, looking not worthy of trust any more.

> The value of a brand comes from a promise that creates expectations in its audience.

### Why do some choose a brand over another?

It's not a secret that Apple devices (computers, tablets, or smartphones) tend to be more expensive than other alternatives on the market.

This price difference has even been called the “Apple tax”, an extra you must pay to be part of the Apple ecosystem.

> This is the value of a brand, what people are willing to pay for a promise

What does Apple promise?

"A unique experience, with a premium, safe product, that uses quality components, high technology, sleek design, and a whole ecosystem with exclusive apps and people who think like me".

These are just some ideas that came to my mind (the brand presence that Apple has in me), other people will have their own, and are is these promises that make us think "**it's worth it**" every time and, "**there's no other brand that gives me the same as they do**".

That last sentence conveys the idea that beyond trust, consumers prefer a **charismatic brand.**

> A charismatic brand is any product, service, or organization for which people believe there is no substitute.

### What makes a charismatic brand different?

Neumeier notes that there is a big gap in the strategy of companies, this gap separates the strategic thinkers of creative thinkers.

One side sees the analytical, logical, linear, numerical, and verbal.

The other side is concerned with the intuitive, emotional, spatial, visual, and physical.

When both parties work together, they can create a charismatic brand.

The best example I can think of is _Coca Cola_.

Coco cola does not (only) sell carbonated water in its ads, they offer good times, the joy of sharing, relaxing with friends, and feelings so deep and abstract as love or Christmas.

The analytical side can create an attractive value proposition through product, price, and other aspects of _the marketing mix_ that can be controlled, but no business has control over the consumer feels.

This is how traditional marketing strategies (targeting demographics) have long worked.

But now companies need to appeal to the feels and emotions of the consumer (directed at psychographics) so they can create a deep connection with the brand.

## Conclusion

The purpose of marketing is a very simple one, to differentiate yourself, to attract the attention of an audience so that they prefer to consume your offer.

It is natural as time passes that there will be more and more options for the consumer, so we must try harder to win their preference.

Previously, a marketing campaign was targeted at a population hoping to capture the largest group of people in a demographic.

Now, the need to create a relationship with the consumer on a personal level has led to more personalized marketing, directed to people according to their tastes, believes, and behavior.

Charismatic brands achieve great success because they know how to combine the strategies of the company with the creative and emotional side of a brand.

It is not enough to turn the consumer into a customer using an attractive promise, it is necessary to delight them with a result that constantly and without fail exceeds their expectations so that they develop confidence in the brand.

Having the consumers' trust gives a great advantage over the competition, but it's not easy work, and once obtained it has to be cherished and treated with respect.
